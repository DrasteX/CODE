Since this is the first chapter of this course, let's start with some basic things you need to know about python.
- Python is a High-level Programming language meaning it isn't as close to machine code as languages like C++. This also makes Python one of the easiest languages to learn!
- Python is an Object Oriented Programming Language meaning that it uses Objects and Classes almost everywhere.
- Python uses an interpreter to run its code meaning that the code is executed line-by-line.

### Setting-Up Python
> Just like i wrote above, Python uses an interpreter to run its code. To start doing anything with this language, we first need to install the Python Interpreter and set-up our development environment.
